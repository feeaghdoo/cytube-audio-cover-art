Addon to cytube that displays embedded cover art in mp3 and ogg vorbis files so you have something to look at while listening to stuff and chatting with friends.

Also tries cover.jpg/.gif/.png and album title.jpg/.gif/.png in the same url path, and cover.txt with multiple cover image filenames on separate lines listed, or audio file specific images using the line format `audio file:image file`.

I guess just dynamically add a script tag that pulls it down or something, should work after that I think?
