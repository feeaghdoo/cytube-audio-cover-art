Addon to cytube that displays embedded cover art in mp3 and ogg vorbis files so you have something to look at while listening to stuff and chatting with friends.

Also tries cover.jpg/.gif/.png and album title.jpg/.gif/.png in the same url path.

I guess just dynamically add a script tag that pulls it down or something, should work after that I think?
